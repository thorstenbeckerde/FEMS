# FEMS
**Fuzzy Emotion Mapping System (FEMS)** is a visual tool for exploring your emotional landscape.

**The Purpose of FEMS:**
FEMS is a visual and intuitive way to make emotional clarity visible. Developed as part of the Attuned Perception Framework, it helps you gently explore your internal landscape by mapping how emotions resonate, relate, and move in relation to your self. The term "fuzzy" reflects the intuitive, non-binary nature of emotionâ€”they blend, pulse, and shift without hard edges. This tool is not for diagnosis; it's an invitation to reflect, externalize, and better understand what already lives within you. Itâ€™s not about controlling your emotions, but about making contact with them.

**Core Concepts:**
* **SELF Node:** The central circle representing your current emotional state.
* **Aspects:** Circles around SELF representing emotional influences (thoughts, people, memories, etc.).
* **Size:** Emotional intensity of an Aspect (larger = stronger).
* **Color:** Emotional tone (e.g., Green for calm, Red for stress). Hover over color buttons for tooltips.
* **Distance to SELF:** Relevance or emotional presence (closer = more pressing).
* **Lines to SELF:** Solid for strong influence, Dashed for subtle/uncertain.
* **Aura Symbols:** Optional emotional modifiers (e.g., ðŸ”’ Blocked, ðŸŒ€ Spiraling). Hover for tooltips.
* **Waveforms:** Sine wave for resonance (feels good), Sawtooth for dissonance (feels off). Amplitude shows strength. Waveform color is high-contrast (typically black) for readability.
